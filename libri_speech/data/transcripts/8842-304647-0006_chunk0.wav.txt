[0.0 - 5.34] The people is a beast of muddy brain that knows not its own force and therefore stands
[5.34 - 11.5] loaded with wood and stone, the powerless hands of a mere child guided with bit and rain.
[11.5 - 17.04] One kick would be enough to break the chain, but the beast fears and what the child demands.
[17.04 - 18.04] It does.
[18.04 - 22.48] Nor its own terror understands, confused and stupified by Bugbear's vein.
