[0.0 - 4.96] Next, take either a large tablespoon full of brewery's yeast, which has been rendered
[4.96 - 10.8] solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water, and letting it afterwards stand a settle
[10.8 - 15.6] for a day and night, or nearly an ounce of German yeast.
[15.6 - 21.84] Put it into a large basin and proceed to mix it so that it shall be as smooth as cream,
[21.84 - 27.48] with ¾ pint of warm milk and water, or with water only.
[27.48 - 30.96] So even a very little milk will much improve the bread.
