From WBEZ Chicago and Public Radio International, it's This American Life. I'm Ira Glass. And let me do something that I've never done before. Let me just reach out and retune your radio for you. You're on the air at WPLP. Good evening, Bob. I'm going to write more than one letter. I'm going to write the station. I'm going to write the chamber of commerce.
