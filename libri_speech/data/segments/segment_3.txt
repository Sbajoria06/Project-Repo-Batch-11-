Next, take either a large tablespoon full of brewery's yeast, which has been rendered solid by mixing it with plenty of cold water, and letting it afterwards stand a settle for a day and night, or nearly an ounce of German yeast. Put it into a large basin and proceed to mix it so that it shall be as smooth as cream, with ¾ pint of warm milk and water, or with water only. So even a very little milk will much improve the bread.
