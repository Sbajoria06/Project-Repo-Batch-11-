[0.0 - 2.0] Or he will even say,
[2.0 - 5.5] for many reasons I can delight in the good opinion of others,
[5.5 - 9.2] perhaps because I love and honor them, and rejoice in all their joys.
[9.2 - 14.7] Perhaps also because their good opinion endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion.
[14.7 - 18.8] Perhaps because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share it,
[18.8 - 22.1] is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness.
[22.1 - 24.3] All this, however, is not vanity.
