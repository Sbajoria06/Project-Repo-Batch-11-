[0.0 - 5.72] Nothing but new wise, nothing but new howls, no common formulas any longer,
[5.72 - 10.96] misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration,
[10.96 - 13.84] and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled,
[13.84 - 18.48] the genius of the race overflowing from all the conucopias of good and bad,
[18.48 - 21.92] a portentious simultaneousness of spring and autumn,
[21.92 - 25.28] full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh,
[25.28 - 28.8] still exhausted, still unwirried corruption.
