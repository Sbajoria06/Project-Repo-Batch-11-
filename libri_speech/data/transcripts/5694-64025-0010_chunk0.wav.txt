[0.0 - 5.56] I had heard and read of battlefields, seen pictures of battlefields, of horses and men
[5.56 - 11.36] of cannon and wagons all jumbled together while the ground was strewn with dead and dying
[11.36 - 12.36] and wounded.
[12.36 - 18.12] But I must confess that I never realized the pomp and circumstance of the thing called
[18.12 - 21.12] glorious war until I saw this.
