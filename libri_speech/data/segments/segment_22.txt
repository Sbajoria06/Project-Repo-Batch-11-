With an education which ought to have ensured me an honorable standing in the world, with some intelligence, wit, good literary and scientific knowledge, and endowed with those accidental physical qualities which are such a good passport into society, I found myself at the age of twenty, the mean follower of a sublime art, in which, if great talent is rightly admired, mediocrity is as rightly despised. I was compelled by poverty to become a member of a musical band, in which I could expect neither esteem nor consideration, and I was well aware that I should be the laughing stock of the persons who had known me as a doctor in divinity, as an ecclesiastic, and as an officer in the army, and had welcomed me in the highest society. They believe that through me they possessed the Philosopher's Stone, the Universal Panacea, the intercourse with all the elementary, heavenly, and infernal spirits. And they had no doubt whatever that, thanks to my sublime science, they could find out the secrets of every government in Europe.
