When they are quite hot, divide them lengthwise into three. Put some thin flakes of good butter between the slices, press the rolls together, and put them in the oven for a minute or two. But not longer, or the butter would oil. Take them out of the oven, spread the butter equally over, divide the rolls in half, and put them on to a very hot, clean dish, and send them instantly to table. These buns may be varied by adding a few currents, Candied peel, or caraway seeds to the other ingredients, and the above mixture answers for hot cross buns by putting in a little ground all spice, and by pressing a tin mold in the form of a cross in the center of the bun.
