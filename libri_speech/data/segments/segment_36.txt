In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the democratic social order and its cause, the blending of the blood of masters and slaves, the original noble and rare impulse of the masters to assign a value to themselves and to think well of themselves will now be more and more encouraged and extended. But it has at all times an older, ample and more radically ingrained propensity opposed to it, and in the phenomenon of vanity this older propensity overmasters the younger. At this turning point of history, there manifest themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like, upgrowth, and upstriving, a kind of tropical tempo in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly exploding egoisms, which strive with one another for sun and light, and can no longer assign any limit restraint or forbearance for themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. Nothing but new wise, nothing but new howls, no common formulas any longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay, deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the genius of the race overflowing from all the conucopias of good and bad, a portentious simultaneousness of spring and autumn, full of new charms and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still exhausted, still unwirried corruption.
